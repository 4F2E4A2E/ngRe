# ReactiveAddons

This project is a proposal for a set of basic angular extensinos to
create a fully reactive Angular application without hacks and workarounds.

Things suggested:
- push-pipe (a pipe similar to async pipe but triggers detectChanges instead of markForCheck)
- multi-let-directive (a directive that enables multiple "o$ | async as varName" bindings on one element)
- reactiveLifeCycleHooks
